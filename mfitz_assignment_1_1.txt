I am M. Fitz, a graduate student with the iSchool. I work full-time for a public library in Children's Services and have worked in various positions for nearly twenty years. 

I prefer to go by "M" and to use neutral pronouns when possible. 

My hobbies include writing and art. I participate in National Novel Writing Month every year and have reached the goal of 50,000 words on thirteen occasions. 

I enjoy savory food with strong umami, but I can't eat things that are still looking back at me or look like they did when it was alive. I don't like mushrooms because I'm always afraid I'll get a poisonous one.
